A bot that daily post information about PostAuto disruptions.
The bot is talking on [@postautoisajoke](https://twitter.com/postautoisajoke)

## The original idea
I was inspired by the french youtuber [Micode](https://youtube.com/channel/UCYnvxJ-PKiGXo_tYXpWAC-w). He created a twitter bot to find out how many trains are late and to calcul the cumulated delay. But the bot is talking about SNCF (French rails company) so I created a Swiss version for buses.
